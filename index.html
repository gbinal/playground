        <p>This repository contains guidance to support the use of standard metadata schema to list agency datasets and APIs as hosted at agency.gov/data.  </p>

<h2>Standard Metadata Vocabulary</h2>

<p>Metadata are selected fields or elements which describe data. The challenge is to define the standard metadata fields and the names of those fields so that the consumer of the data has sufficient information to process and understand the data. The more information that can be conveyed in a standardized regular format, the more valuable data becomes. Metadata can range from basic to advanced â€“ from allowing one to discover the mere fact that a certain data asset exists and is about a general subject all the way to providing detailed semantic information that enables a high degree of machine readability. Making the metadata machine readable greatly increases its openness and utility.</p>

<p>Establishing a common vocabulary is the key to any communication, including communication between machines.  <a href="http://www.schema.org">Schema.org</a> is a hierarchical vocabulary that is being developed through a collaboration of the major search engines and serves as the basis for the <strong>common core metadata</strong> required in this memorandum. The standard consists of a number of schemas (hierarchical vocabulary terms) that represent things that are most often looked for on the web and encapsulates many of the early lessons learned from vocabulary development.  </p>

<h2>What to Document -- Datasets and APIs</h2>

<p>APIs or Application Programming Interfaces are allow developers (both internal to the agency and the public) to dynamically query a dataset. For example, a dataset <a href="https://explore.data.gov/Agriculture/Farmers-Markets-Geographic-Data/wfna-38ey">of farmers markets</a> may be made available for download as a single file (e.g., a CSV), or may be made available to developers as an API, such that a developer could provide the agency with a zipcode, and retrieve a list of farmers markets in that area.</p>

<p>The catalog file should include <em>both</em> datasets and APIs. Agencies can use the dcat:webService, dcat:download, and dcat:distribution properties to distinguish between datasets and dynamic APIs (see below for more information on Common Core and Extensional metadata elements).</p>

<h2>Metadata File Formats --  RDFa and JSON</h2>

<p>The Implemention Guidance available as a part of Project Open Data describes Agency requirements for the development of metadata as per the Open Data Policy.  A quick primer on these two file formats follows:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-lite/">RDFa Lite</a> is a minimal subset of RDFa, the Resource Description Framework in attributes, consisting of a few attributes that may be used to express machine-readable data in Web documents like HTML and XML. While it is not a complete solution for advanced data markup tasks, it allows users to publish metadata in a way that is immediately understandable by search engines and other applications built to leverage the growing "web of data."  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a> is a lightweight data-exchange format that is very easy to read, parse and generate.  Based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language, JSON is a text format that is optimized for data interchange.  JSON is built on two structures: (1) a collection of name/value pairs; and (2) an ordered list of values.  </p>

<p>Links to downloadable examples of metadata files developed in both of these formats can be found at the bottom of this page.  Tools to help agencies produce and maintain their data inventories are available <a href=".">Coming Soon</a></p>

<h2>"Common Core" Required Fields</h2>

<p>The following "common core" fields are required and used to describe each dataset:</p>

<h2>Beyond Common Core -- Extending the Schema</h2>

<p>"Extensional" and/or domain specific metadata can easily be added using other vocabularies to embedded HTML or XML markup even if it is not a term (entity/property) that will get indexed by the major search engines - it could still be indexed by other custom search engines and by Data.gov.  Agencies are encouraged to extend their metadata descriptions using elements from the "Expanded Fields" list shown below, or from any well-known vocabulary (including Dublin Core, FGDC, ISO 19115, NIEM, and a growing number of vocabularies published at <a href="http://vocab.data.gov">vocab.data.gov</a>) as long as they are properly assigned.</p>

<h2>Expanded Fields</h2>

<p>Agencies our encourage to use the following expanded fields when appropriate. Agencies may freely augment these fields with their own.</p>
